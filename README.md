As a member of the Mobile2App company team, we have been enlisted to assist in the development of a mobile application called Inventory App (Option 1), which aims to track items in a warehouse. This mobile application project will progress through various stages, including planning, design, and development, with the goal of being ready for launch in the coming weeks.

Our team takes the time to familiarize ourselves with the project's objectives and target audience. We hold weekly meetings to discuss the latest client requests and assign tasks, ensuring that we implement mobile application development principles and best practices throughout the development process.
The primary goal of the Inventory application is to track items in an inventory list using mobile devices. For instance, this app will facilitate the management and automation of warehouse logistics, contributing to the business's growth and expansion. It offers users the flexibility to access real-time inventory information from any device, providing a seamless experience. Initially, the app will be developed for Android devices.

To achieve these goals, the initial set of features requested for the mobile application includes:

* A database with at least two tables to store inventory items, user logins, and passwords.
* A sign-in or sign-up screen to access the app.
* A grid screen that displays all items in the inventory.
* Functionality for adding and removing items from the inventory.
* The ability to increase or decrease the quantity of specific items in the inventory.


Notifications to alert users when the quantity of any item in the inventory reaches zero.
Throughout the design and development process, I aim to demonstrate my skills and abilities in software design, considering and interpreting user needs, and implementing them into a well-organized program. I strive to integrate the presentation and layout aspects of the user interface with the programmatic phase of the application.

# Design Planning Paper for the Inventory Mobile App:

As a designer and engineer, my initial step is to plan and outline the purpose of the app and identify the target audience. Each audience has unique requirements, and I must interpret their needs and prioritize them accordingly. It's important to address the most important or favored features first when incorporating them into the app's initial launch. Additionally, I research competitive apps to gain insights on how they approach app design, resolve UI/UX challenges, and incorporate similar features to our concept. Conducting thorough research in app stores and online helps inform our implementation strategy.

# Development Paper for the Inventory Mobile App:

The mobile application design process entails numerous considerations, and understanding this process is crucial to deliver a high-quality app that meets our target audience's expectations. It's unrealistic to expect that we can create an exceptional application entirely on our own. To achieve success, we must assemble a collaborative team that can guide us, helping us comprehend and implement good practices in mobile app development. We should focus on integrating design components and programmatic code while continuously seeking opportunities to improve and innovate the mobile app to overcome challenges.

# Reflection:

This artifact demonstrates my ability to utilize well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices to deliver valuable computer solutions aligned with industry-specific goals. The artifact encompasses the entire software design and engineering process, involving considerations of user experience and interaction across various screens and actions within the application. I strive to ensure an intuitive user experience through industry-standard icons and symbols, as well as a relational database to store data that users create, read, update, and delete during app usage.
